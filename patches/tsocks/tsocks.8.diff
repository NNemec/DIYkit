 .BR tsocks
 is a library to allow transparent SOCKS proxying. It wraps the normal
-connect() function. When a connection is attempted, it consults the 
-configuration file (which is defined at configure time but defaults to 
-/etc/tsocks.conf) and determines if the IP address specified is local. If 
-it is not, the library redirects the connection to a SOCKS server
-specified in the configuration file. It then negotiates that connection
-with the SOCKS server and passes the connection back to the calling
-program.
