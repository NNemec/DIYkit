NNlab -- simple and clean $HOME installation of source packages
=====================================================

If you frequently work on Unix/Linux systems that you do not
administrate yourself, NNlab is the solution to comfortably install
software into your $HOME directory:

-> Create a single directory (e.g. ~/NNlab/ ) for user-installed
libraries and programs.

-> Set up the environment to access the installed software

-> Download, compile and install a large number of pre-configured
software packages. (Automatically resolving any dependencies.)

-> Easily add missing software packages. (Feel free to contribute them
back!)


INITIAL SET-UP
==============

Currently, NNlab can only be obtained via git. A tar archive will
be made available in the near future. Ask for it if you require this.

Follow these steps:

Check out the NNlab directory directly into your $HOME directory
    git clone git://github.com/NNemec/NNlab.git

Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:
    [ -d ~/NNlab ] && . ~/NNlab/NNlab.sh

Close the current shell and start a new one to activate the NNlab
environment.


INSTALLING SOFTWARE
===================

The following actions can be performed anywhere from the command line:

View the available pre-configured packages:
   NNlab avail

Install a pre-configured package (e.g. NumPy) type:
   NNlab install numpy

Conditionally install a package if it is not available:
   NNlab depend numpy


ADDING NEW SOFTWARE PACKAGES
============================

Simply add a new *.sh files to the ~/NNlab/ directory. See the existing
packages for examples. Software using autoconf or similar standards
can be added with just a few lines. Beyond this, the files are plain
bash scripts that can accomodate arbitrarily non-standard installation
procedures.

Currently the NNlab system is in early development. If you want to use
it, I would be delighted to hear about your experience!
